FIPS CODE ANALYSIS
--



### Data is from following link:

https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/boundary-change-notes.html

This is analysis of FIPS CODE to understand FIPS CODE and how it has been changed.

I included API notebook because from City Health Website, multi-year data are available only through the Dashboardâ€™s API. Due to file size constraints, the downloadable .csv and .txt files contain only the most recently available year of data for each metric.
